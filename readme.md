# üêá RabbitRs ‚Äî PHP AMQP Extension Powered by Rust

This library is in it's early stage and need some more care before production usage. 

RabbitRs is a native PHP extension implemented in Rust with
[`ext-php-rs`](https://github.com/davidcole1340/ext-php-rs). It provides a fast,
memory-safe AMQP 0-9-1 client built on top of
[`lapin`](https://crates.io/crates/lapin), and is designed as a drop-in upgrade
for [`php-amqplib`](https://github.com/php-amqplib/php-amqplib).

RabbitRs was born from running RabbitMQ at scale and fighting connection storms.
The project focuses on reusing connections, delivering predictable throughput,
and giving PHP developers the ergonomics they expect from `php-amqplib` while
leveraging the performance and safety of Rust.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Zero PHP FFI** ‚Äì native Zend extension compiled from Rust.
- **Shared connection model** ‚Äì one TCP/TLS connection per PHP worker, reused by
  every `PhpClient` in the same process.
- **Publisher confirms** ‚Äì confirm mode enabled by default with blocking
  confirms, plus compatibility helpers (`confirmSelect`, `waitForConfirms`).
- **Manual or automatic acknowledgements** ‚Äì full control over
  `ack`/`nack`/`reject`, matching `php-amqplib` semantics.
- **Consumer QoS** ‚Äì manual QoS or adaptive auto-tuning that grows/shrinks the
  prefetch based on observed throughput.
- **TLS & reconnection** ‚Äì native TLS via `rustls` with configurable
  reconnect/backoff policies.
- **Full message metadata** ‚Äì headers, properties, and binary payloads flow both
  ways without lossy conversions.

## üß± Architecture Overview

| Layer            | Implementation details                                                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PHP API          | Classes generated with `ext-php-rs` (`Goopil\RabbitRs\PhpClient`, `Goopil\RabbitRs\PhpChannel`, ‚Ä¶). |
| Core runtime     | Asynchronous orchestration with `tokio`, message pipelines on top of `lapin`.                       |
| Connection model | `once_cell` + `parking_lot` locks coordinate a single shared connection per process.                |
| Backpressure     | Adaptive QoS uses moving windows and cooldowns to resize prefetch without thundering.               |
| Observability    | `tracing` instrumentation is available when compiled with the `tracing` feature flag.               |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.89+
- PHP 8.2 ‚Äì 8.5 (CLI, FPM, or Apache module)
- RabbitMQ (local or remote) for integration tests

### Build the extension

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled module is available in `target/release/librabbit_rs.(so|dylib|dll)`
depending on your platform.

### Enable the extension

Add the module to your `php.ini` (or drop a `.ini` in `conf.d`):

```ini
extension=/path/to/target/release/librabbit_rs.so
```

Verify the load:

```bash
php -m | grep rabbit_rs
```

## üì¶ Composer Installer Plugin

A Composer plugin is provided under `php/composer-plugin`. It:

1. Detects the current platform/architecture (`linux-gnu`, `linux-musl`,
   `darwin`, `windows` + `x86_64`/`aarch64`).
2. Downloads the matching prebuilt binary from GitHub Releases.
3. Caches the module under `vendor/rabbit-rs/ext/<platform>/php<version>`.
4. Publishes `RabbitRs.stub.php` for IDE autocompletion.

Minimal configuration snippet:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "goopil/rabbit-rs-installer": "^0.1"
  },
  "extra": {
    "rabbit-rs": {
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "download_template": "https://github.com/goopil/php-rabbit-rs/releases/download/%tag%/%file%"
    }
  }
}
```

Set `RABBIT_RS_VERSION=vX.Y.Z` to override the release tag or
`RABBIT_RS_FORCE_INSTALL=1` to force a re-download.

## üí° Usage Samples

### Basic connection

```php
use Goopil\RabbitRs\PhpClient;

$client = new PhpClient([
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'user' => 'guest',
    'password' => 'guest',
]);

$client->connect();          // idempotent
$channel = $client->openChannel();
$channel->queueDeclare('jobs', ['durable' => true]);
$channel->basicPublish('', 'jobs', new Goopil\RabbitRs\AmqpMessage('hello'));
```

### TLS connection

```php
$client = new PhpClient([
    'host' => 'my-rabbit',
    'port' => 5671,
    'user' => 'guest',
    'password' => 'guest',
    'ssl' => [
        'cafile' => '/path/ca.pem',
        'certfile' => '/path/client.pem',
        'keyfile' => '/path/client.key',
    ],
]);

$client->connect();
```

### Reconnect with exponential backoff

```php
$client = new PhpClient([
    'host' => 'cluster',
    'user' => 'guest',
    'password' => 'guest',
    'reconnect' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'max_retries' => 5,
        'initial_delay_ms' => 100,
        'max_delay_ms' => 5000,
        'jitter' => 0.2,
    ],
]);

$client->connect();
```

## üß™ Testing

- **Rust unit tests**: `cargo test --all`
- **PHP integration suite**: `bash run-test.sh`  
  Spins up RabbitMQ with Docker Compose, builds the extension (debug or release),
  and runs Pest tests from `php/tests/`.
- **Benchmarks**: `bash run-benchmarks.sh`  
  Launches a dedicated RabbitMQ instance, ensures benchmark dependencies are
  installed, and executes the comparison suite under `php/benchmarks/`.

The GitHub Actions CI workflow executes formatting checks (`cargo fmt`),
`clippy`, Rust tests, and the integration suite on PHP 8.2.

## üõ†Ô∏è Release & Distribution

Tagged releases trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which:

1. Builds Linux glibc binaries directly on Ubuntu runners.
2. Builds Linux musl binaries with dedicated Docker builders (`docker/linux-*`).
3. Compiles macOS (x86_64 & arm64) using `shivammathur/setup-php`.
4. Packages artifacts via `scripts/package-extension.sh`, producing `.zip` files,
   `.ini` snippets, and SHA256 sums.
5. Publishes everything to the GitHub Release along with an aggregated checksum
   manifest.

Future work includes native Linux packages (`.deb`, `.rpm`) and Windows builds.
